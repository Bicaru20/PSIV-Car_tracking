# Car Tracking with YOLO v8 and Background Subtraction

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains the code and resources for a car tracking system that combines YOLO v8 (You Only Look Once version 8) for object detection and background subtraction for more robust tracking. The project is aimed at tracking cars in various scenarios, such as surveillance, traffic management, or autonomous vehicle navigation.

## Features

- Object detection using YOLO v8 for identifying and tracking cars.
- Background subtraction to enhance the accuracy of car tracking.
- Example datasets and pre-trained YOLO weights for quick setup.
- Easy-to-use Python scripts for tracking and visualization.
- Detailed documentation and usage instructions.
